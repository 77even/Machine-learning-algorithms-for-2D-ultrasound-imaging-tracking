# Machine-learning-algorithms-for-2D-ultrasound-imaging-tracking
Machine learning algorithms, simulations and experiments for 3D tracking of needles with integrated ultrasound transducers within the field of 2D ultrasound imaging


Project overview:

(1)Development of CNN and UNet based architecture to enable identification of features in FOH waveforms or prediction of the probe position based on its location in ultrasound images

(2)The final accuracy of the validated model reaches 0.8 when tested with new data obtained from the same set of MATLAB experimental simulations
